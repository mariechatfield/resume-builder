      I am a fullstack contributor to our knowledge-graph-based data catalog with a special focus on search and discovery. I have:
      - Shipped high-impact, high-risk initiatives by designing an entire program around them—not just the code, but the communication, education, and rollout strategy needed to minimize customer disruption while maximizing adoption for major UX overhauls and foundational technical changes.
      - Brought thoughtful judgment to architectural decisions and evaluated tradeoffs with awareness of customer needs and business priorities. Built full-stack systems with React, Node.js, Java, Elasticsearch, and LLM integrations, with particular attention to accessibility and semantic HTML/CSS.
      - Cultivated deep cross-functional relationships with product, design, customer success, and revenue teams by consistently delivering on commitments and making others feel heard and capable.
      - Served as a knowledge multiplier for the team: created learning resources, internal talks, and documentation that elevate collective capability and reduce time-to-productivity for new engineers.
      - Developed emerging talent by creating growth opportunities: partnered with engineers at various levels and collaborated with their managers to identify stretch projects and accelerate skill development.
      - Identified systemic friction points within the team and designed lightweight practices that improve developer quality of life—reducing on-call burden, strengthening documentation standards, and accelerating onboarding.

      I worked on our graph-backed org chart and employee management product using React and Ruby, where I:
        - Consistently shipped intricate, accessible features on time by combining rapid prototyping to derisk product decisions with polish and attention to detail—including a mobile-ready drag-and-drop editor for the org chart and Slack slash commands with account binding.
        - Collaborated closely with product and design through discovery, scoping, and shipping—including user research, design iteration, and adoption metrics—earning trust as a partner in defining what to build.
        - Advocated for user privacy throughout the development process, establishing practices to consider security implications from planning through code review.
        - Designed the technical interview framework and evaluation system for engineering internship hiring, then managed an intern through structured feedback and development.

      As a frontend-focused engineer building employee management features with Ember.js, Ruby, and Java, I:
        - Designed, built, and maintained full-stack features with complex visual requirements, including coordinating a three-engineer team through a four-month project and leading reprioritization when requirements changed.

      While working on a frontend infrastructure team supporting all back office software products, I:
        - Optimized test infrastructure (up to 94% reduction in test resources), rolled out strict Content Security Policy without disruption, and created systems to identify and track test flakes—which were adopted by four other teams.
        - Researched developer needs through quarterly surveys and documentation of institutional knowledge and processes, driving improvements to the frontend infra team's roadmap and tooling.

      Beyond core responsibilities, I:
         - Organized and facilitated community-building initiatives—external technical talks, internal career panels, women-in-engineering roundtables, and accomplishment-tracking workshops.
         - Conducted 100+ technical interviews and managed an intern through structured feedback and development, investing significantly in hiring and growing the engineering team.
