      I am a fullstack contributor to our knowledge-graph-based data catalog with a special focus on search and discovery. I have:
      - **Shipped multiple high-impact, high-risk projects** with an emphasis on minimizing disruption while maximizing adoption. Holistic approach considers technical structure, rollout strategies, metrics, monitoring, and enablement.
          + Navigation/IA overhauls; UX refreshes; foundational changes to ACL models and core graph APIs.
      - **Made strategical architectural decisions** across full-stack systems (React, Node.js, Java, Elasticsearch, LLM integrations) by weighing technical tradeoffs against customer needs and business priorities.
      - **Cultivated deep cross-functional relationships** with product, design, customer success, and revenue teams by consistently delivering on commitments and making others feel heard and capable.
      - **Elevated team capability as a knowledge multiplier:** created learning resources, internal talks, and documentation that accelerate skill development, while partnering with engineers and their managers to create growth opportunities.
      - **Improved developer quality of life** by identifying systemic friction points and designing lightweight practices—reducing on-call burden, strengthening documentation standards, and accelerating onboarding.

          + Mobile-ready drag-and-drop editor for the org chart; Slack slash commands with account binding; peer kudos.
      - **Collaborated closely with product and design** through discovery, scoping, and shipping—including user research, design iteration, and adoption metrics—earning trust as a partner in defining what to build.
      - **Advocated for user privacy** throughout the development process, establishing practices to consider security implications from planning through code review.

      As a frontend-focused engineer building employee management features with Ember.js, Ruby, and Java, I:
      - **Designed, built, and maintained full-stack features** with complex visual requirements, including coordinating a three-engineer team through a four-month project and leading reprioritization when requirements changed.
          + Feedback survey component used by 15 other teams; timeline view of timecards.

      While working on a frontend infrastructure team supporting all back office software products, I:
      - **Enhanced frontend tooling and reliability** by optimizing test infrastructure (94% reduction in test resources) and creating systems to track test flakes—improvements which were adopted by four other teams.
      - **Influenced team roadmap with user research** by creating quarterly surveys of developer pain points and documenting institutional knowledge and processes.

      Beyond core responsibilities, I:
        - **Organized and facilitated community-building initiatives**—external technical talks, internal career panels, women-in-engineering roundtables, and accomplishment-tracking workshops.
        - **Conducted 100+ technical interviews** and managed an intern through structured feedback and development, investing significantly in hiring and growing the engineering team.
